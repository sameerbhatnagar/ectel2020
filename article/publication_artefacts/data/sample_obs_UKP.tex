 I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the 
 gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If 
 they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand 
 and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can 
 feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better 
 than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In 
 my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes 
 during my student days. &  \textit{I think it is bad to wear school uniform 
 because it makes you look unatrel and you cannot express yourself enough so 
 band school uniform OK} \\
